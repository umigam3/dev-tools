              While working on my personal projects to learn different technologies, I often found myself referring to a small bookmark folder where

              One day, an idea pop up: 
              "Why not create a <span className="font-bold text-white">directory of developer tools</span> and encourage everyone to collaborate and share their favorite tools?" 
              This is why alltoolsdev was born, a place to discover new tools that enhance your workflow and to share your favorites, 
              contributing to this wonderful community.
